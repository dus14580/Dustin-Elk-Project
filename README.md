## Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the playbook file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly available, in addition to restricting inbound access to the network.
The load balancer ensures that work to process incoming traffic will be shared by both vulnerable web servers. Access controls will ensure that only authorized users â€” namely, ourselves will be able to connect in the first place.

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the file systems of the VMs on the network and system as well as watch system metrics, such as CPU usage; attempted SSH logins; sudo escalation failures; etc.

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.

| Name     | Function | IP Address | Operating System |
|----------|----------|------------|------------------|
| Jump Box |Gateway   | 10.0.0.1   | Linux            |
| Web 1    |Web Server| 10.0.0.5   | Linux            |
| Web 2    |Web Server| 10.0.0.6   | Linux            |
| ELKServer|Monitoring| 10.1.0.5   | Linux            |

 Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the Jumpbox machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:
- 20.24.217.132

Machines within the network can only be accessed by the JumpBox.
The Web1 and Web2 VM's send traffic to the ELK Server.

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name     | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Addresses |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Jump Box | Yes                 | 20.24.217.132        |
| ELKServer| No                  | 10.1.0.5             |
| Web1     | No                  | 10.0.0.5             |
| Web2     | No                  | 10.0.0.6             |
### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because...
- Using the playbook automates the process which saves time.

The playbook implements the following tasks:
- _TODO: In 3-5 bullets, explain the steps of the ELK installation play. E.g., install Docker; download image; etc._
- Configure Elk VM with Docker
- Install docker.io
- Increase virtual memory
The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
-Web1 10.0.0.5
-Web2 10.0.0.6

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
-Filebeat
-Metricbeat
-Packetbeat

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
- Filebeat watches for log files/locations and collects log events.
- Metricbeat records metrics and statistical data from the operating system and from services running on the server.

### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the filebeat-config.yml and metricbeat-config.yml file to /etc/ansible.
- Update the configuration files to include the Private IP of the ELK-Server to the ElasticSearch and Kibana Sections of the Configuration File.
- Run the playbook, and navigate to ELK-Server-PublicIP:5601/app/kibana to check that the installation worked as expected.

_TODO: Answer the following questions to fill in the blanks:_
- _Which file is the playbook?
- elk-playbook.yml 
- Where do you copy it?
- /etc/ansible/
- _Which file do you update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific machine? 
- filebeat-config.yml, metricbeat-config.yml
- How do I specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on?
- In the /etc/ansible/hosts.
- Which URL do you navigate to in order to check that the ELK server is running?
- http://52.188.106.10:5601/app/kibana

_As a **Bonus**, provide the specific commands the user will need to run to download the playbook, update the files, etc._
